            <p class="event_text">FArbucks is committed to significantly reducing the waste generated and always strives to create a sustainable business. Some of the "green" steps that have been taken include the use of strawless lids to reduce the use of plastic straws, to the "Tumbler Day" program. This program itself is a Starbucks initiative on the 22nd of every month which is inspired by Earth Day which is celebrated on April 22.

            <p class="event_text">Tumbler Day is quite special because apart from giving customers a 30-50% discount* every Thursday and the 22nd of every month for their favorite drink if they bring an official FArbucks tumbler, this program is also one of FArbucks' steps to reduce the use of single-use plastic in stores.</p>

            <p class="event_text">In addition to the 22nd and every Thursday, FArbucks also continues to explore innovative ways to create a “green” movement, one of which is through the daily “Bring Your Own Tumbler” program. Similar to Tumbler Day, this program is carried out by FArbucks by giving a discount of Rp. 5,000, - if the customer buys a drink and brings his own official FArbucks tumbler. Let's create a #BetterWorldTogether with us!</p>
